# Binary Trees Project

This project involves implementing a binary tree and related functions in C. Each task builds upon the previous one, gradually creating a fully functional binary tree.

## Task 0: New Node

- **Description**: This task involves creating a function that initializes a new binary tree node.
- **Prototype**: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
